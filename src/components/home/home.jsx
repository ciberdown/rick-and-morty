            Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom
            created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's
            nighttime programming block Adult Swim. The series follows the
            misadventures of Rick Sanchez, a cynical mad scientist, and his
            good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time
            between domestic life and interdimensional adventures that take
            place across an infinite number of realities, often traveling to
            other planets and dimensions through portals and on Rick's flying
            saucer. The general concept of Rick and Morty relies on two
            conflicting scenarios: domestic family drama, and a misanthropic
            grandfather dragging his grandson into hijinks. Roiland voiced the
            eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer, and Sarah
            Chalke voicing the rest of Rick and Morty's family. The series
            originated from an animated short parody film of Back to the Future
            created by Roiland for Channel 101, a short-film festival cofounded
            by Harmon. Since its debut, the series has received critical acclaim
            for its originality, creativity, and humor. It has been nominated
            for three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program and
            won the award in 2018 and 2020. The series has also received two
            Annie Awards. At times, the series has been the most viewed
            television comedy for adults between 18 and 24. The popularity of
            Rick and Morty has made it a hundred-million dollar merchandising
            and media franchise. The sixth season premiered on September 4,
            2022, and consists of ten episodes. A seventh season was confirmed
            as part of a long-term deal with Cartoon Network that ordered 70 new
            episodes, which renewed the series through to a tenth season. Adult
            Swim cut ties with Roiland in 2023 amid allegations of domestic
            abuse and announced it would be recasting his roles with soundalike
            actors.

          <p className="justify">
            The show revolves around the adventures of the members of the Smith
            household, which consists of parents Jerry and Beth, their children
            Summer and Morty, and Beth's father, Rick Sanchez, who lives with
            them as a guest. According to Justin Roiland, the family lives
            outside of Seattle, Washington. The adventures of Rick and Morty,
            however, take place across an infinite number of realities, with the
            characters traveling to other planets and dimensions through portals
            and Rick's flying saucer. Rick is an eccentric and alcoholic mad
            scientist, who eschews many ordinary conventions such as school,
            marriage, love, and family. He frequently goes on adventures with
            his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, a kind-hearted but easily
            distressed boy, whose naïve but grounded moral compass plays
            counterpoint to Rick's Machiavellian ego. Morty's 17-year-old
            sister, Summer, is a more conventional teenager who worries about
            improving her status among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and
            Morty on their adventures. The kids' mother, Beth, is a generally
            level-headed person and assertive force in the household, though
            self-conscious about her professional role as a horse surgeon. She
            is dissatisfied with her marriage to Jerry, a simple-minded and
            insecure person, who disapproves of Rick's influence over his
            family. Different versions of the characters inhabit other
            dimensions throughout the show's multiverse and their personal
            characteristics can vary from one reality to another. The show's
            original Rick identifies himself as "Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension
            C-137", in reference to his original universe, but this does not
            apply to any other member of the Smith household. For instance, in
            the first-season episode "Rick Potion #9", after turning the entire
            world population into monsters, Rick and Morty move to a different
            dimension, leaving the original Summer, Beth and Jerry behind.

      <h1>Production</h1>
      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p className="justify">
        Rick and Morty was created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon. The duo
        first met at Channel 101, a non-profit monthly short film festival in
        Los Angeles co-founded by Harmon. At Channel 101, participants submit a
        short film in the format of a pilot, and a live audience decides which
        pilots continue as a series. Roiland, then a producer on reality
        programming, began submitting content to the festival a year after its
        launch, in 2004. His pilots typically consisted of shock value—"sick and
        twisted" elements that received a confused reaction from the audience.
        Nevertheless, Harmon took a liking to his humor and the two began
        collaborating. In 2006, Roiland was fired from working on a television
        series he regarded as creatively stifling, and funneled his creative
        energies into creating a webisode for Channel 101. The result was The
        Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti, an animated short starring
        parodies of Doc Brown and Marty McFly, characters from the Back to the
        Future film trilogy. In the short, which Harmon would dub "a
        bastardization, a pornographic vandalization", Doc Smith urges Mharti to
        perform oral sex on him in order to go back in time. The audience
        reacted to it wildly, and Roiland began creating more shorts involving
        the characters, which soon evolved beyond his original intentions and
        their obvious origin within the film from which it was culled. Harmon
        would later create and produce Community, an NBC sitcom, while Roiland
        would work primarily in voice acting for Disney's Fish Hooks and Cartoon
        Network's Adventure Time. In 2012, Harmon was briefly fired from
        Community. Adult Swim, searching for a more prime-time, "hit" show,
        shortly afterward approached Harmon, who initially viewed the channel as
        unfit for his style. He was also unfamiliar with animation and his
        process for creating television focused more heavily on dialogue,
        characters, and story. Instead, he phoned Roiland to inquire if he had
        any ideas for an animated series. Roiland immediately brought up the
        idea of using the Doc and Mharti characters, renamed Rick and Morty. At
        first, Roiland wanted the show's run time to consist of one
        eleven-minute segment, but Adult Swim pushed for a half-hour program.
        Harmon felt the best way to extend the voices into a program would be to
        build a family around the characters, while Adult Swim development
        executive Nick Weidenfeld suggested that Rick be Morty's grandfather.
        Having pitched multiple television programs that did not get off the
        ground, Roiland was initially very unreceptive to others attempting to
        give notes on his pitch. Prior to developing Rick and Morty, he had
        created three failed animated pilots for Fox, and he had begun to feel
        "burned out" with developing television. The first draft was completed
        in six hours on the Paramount Pictures lot in Dan Harmon's unfurnished
        Community office. The duo had worked out the basics of the story that
        day, sold the pilot, and then sat down to write. Roiland, while
        acknowledging a tendency for procrastination, encouraged Harmon to stay
        and write the entire first draft. "We were sitting on the floor,
        cross-legged with laptops and I was about to get up and go home and he
        said, 'Wait, if you go home, it might take us three months to write this
        thing. Stay here right now and we can write it in six hours.' He just
        had a premonition about that," recalled Harmon. In the beginning, Adult
        Swim was unsure of Roiland doing both voices, partially due to the
        undeveloped nature of the character of Morty. Harmon wrote four short
        premises in which Morty took a more assertive role and sent it to Mike
        Lazzo. Adult Swim placed a tamer TV-14 rating on the program, which was
        met with reluctance from the show's staff. The network's reason behind
        the rating was that it would soon begin broadcasting in prime-time,
        competing with major programs. The theme song for Rick and Morty by Ryan
        Elder was originally used in a rejected Cartoon Network pilot Roiland
        made called "Dog World", which was referenced in the episode "Lawnmower
        Dog".
      </p>
      <h2>Writing</h2>
      <p className="justify">
        Harmon has noted that the writers' room at the show's studio bears a
        striking resemblance to the one used for Community. In comparing the
        two, he noted that the writing staff of Rick and Morty was significantly
        smaller, and more "rough and tumble verbally". The first season writing
        staff consisted of Roiland, Harmon, Tom Kauffman, Ryan Ridley, Wade
        Randolph, and Eric Acosta, while writer's assistant Mike McMahan was
        also given writing credit. Described as a "very, very tiny little
        writers' room with a lot of heavy lifting from everybody," the show's
        writing staff, like many Adult Swim productions, is not unionized with
        the Writers Guild of America, though in 2022 production staff at Rick &
        Morty filed a petition for a union election with the National Labor
        Relations Board in a bid to join The Animation Guild. The writing staff
        first meets and discusses ideas, which evolve into a story. Discussions
        often include anecdotes from personal life as well as thoughts on the
        science fiction genre. After breaking the story—which consists of
        developing its consistency and logical beginning, middle, and
        conclusion—a writer is assigned to create an outline. Roiland and Harmon
        do a "pass" on the outline, and from there the episode undergoes several
        more drafts. The final draft of the script is last approved by either of
        the co-creators. Harmon has admitted that his perfectionism can
        sometimes be disruptive and cause writing schedule delays. For the most
        part, this was the reason why the third season of the show consisted of
        only 10 episodes instead of 14, as was initially intended. Many episodes
        are structured with use of a story circle, a Harmon creation based
        largely on Joseph Campbell's monomyth, or The Hero's Journey. Its
        two-act structure places the act break at an odd location in the stages
        of the monomyth: after The Meeting with the Goddess, instead of
        Atonement with the Father. Roiland has stated his and Harmon's
        intentions for the series to lack traditional continuity, opting for
        discontinuous storylines "not bound by rules". He has also confirmed
        that the writers avoid revisiting old tropes from the show's past, "in
        fear of that coming off as disingenuous fan service." In producing the
        series' first season, episodes were occasionally written out of order.
        For example, "Rick Potion #9" was the second episode written for the
        series, but was instructed to be animated as the fifth, as it would make
        more sense within the series' continuity
      </p>
      <h2>Animation and voice recording</h2>
      <p className="justify">
        Animation for the show is done using Toon Boom Harmony, a vector-based
        2D puppet software, which is a more economical option than traditional
        hand-drawn animation. The post-production work is done in Adobe After
        Effects, and background art is done in Adobe Photoshop. Production of
        animation is handled by Bardel Entertainment in Vancouver, Canada.
        Roiland's cartooning style is heavily indebted to The Simpsons, a factor
        he acknowledged in a 2013 interview, while also comparing his style to
        that of Pendleton Ward (Adventure Time) and J. G. Quintel (Regular
        Show): "You'll notice mouths are kind of similar and teeth are similar,
        but I think that's also a stylistic thing that ... all of us are kind of
        the same age, and we're all inspired by The Simpsons and all these other
        shows we're kind of subconsciously tapping into." John Kricfalusi's The
        Ren & Stimpy Show was another strong influence for Rick and Morty, which
        is why, according to Roiland, the small "w-shaped mouths" that the
        characters occasionally make is a reference to a similar expression that
        Ren frequently makes. Talking about the style guide the animators of the
        show have to follow, season three art director Jeffrey Thompson
        explained that the characters are often drawn with odd or asymmetrical
        features, in order to avoid looking "too normal to live in the Rick and
        Morty universe." When recording dialogue, Roiland does a considerable
        amount of improvisation, in order to make the characters feel more
        natural.
      </p>
      <h2>Roiland's firing</h2>
      <p className="justify">
        In January 2023, it was reported that Roiland was charged with felony
        domestic battery and false imprisonment in Orange County, California, in
        connection with an alleged incident in January 2020 toward an unnamed
        woman he was reportedly dating at the time. A hearing was scheduled for
        April 27, 2023. Following the public revelation of the indictment,
        allegations against Roiland's personal conduct regarding his behavior to
        minors on social media were made. The same month, Adult Swim announced
        that they had cut ties with Roiland and fired him from the show stating
        that the seventh season's production would continue and that his roles
        would be recast. In March 2023, the Orange County District Attorney's
        office dropped all criminal charges against Roiland due to insufficient
        evidence. During San Diego Comic-Con 2023, producer Steve Levy stated
        that Roiland's voice work will be replaced by "soundalikes" but there
        will otherwise be no changes in the characters.
